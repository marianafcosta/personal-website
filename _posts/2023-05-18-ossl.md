I was trying to get an Android-only React Native app running, but I kept coming across this error. It was apparently introduced in Node.js 17, as described in the [release notes](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V17.md#openssl-30) for that version. I tried the solutions that I found from a quick Google search but didn't have much success:

- Setting `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` didn't work since npm complained that the value was not allowed;
- Using `nvm` to ensure I was using the appropriate Node.js version for the project (14) didn't work.

I then decided to use `nvm list` to check which versions were available, and noticed I had Node.js 18 installed, but it wasn't set as the current version (which was expected, since I had used `nvm use` before). However, the `package.json` script I was running called the globally installed `node`, and for some reason, it wasn't respecting the version set by `nvm`; it seems it was using Node.js 18. Although there was probably a more elegant way to deal with this, temporarily deleting the offending version did the trick.
