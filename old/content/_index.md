- Hi! I'm **Mariana Costa**, a recent graduate from [**FEUP**'s BSc + MSc in **Informatics and Computer Engineering**](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=742).
- Most familiar with **web development**, but keen on exploring other areas of software engineering, such as **software development**.
- In my free time, I usually cycle between playing my Switch (currently struggling at Slay the Spire), reading, and scouring caf√©s in the city.
- You can take a look at my **[CV](/cv)** or **[download it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_PPB1LLOHgxDvCT9A6aIt2Q9o7y-ykvg/view?usp=sharing)**!
