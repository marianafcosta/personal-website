Hi! I’m Mariana Costa, a Software Developer at [Hybrid Heroes](https://hybridheroes.de). Most familiar with web and mobile development, but above all interested in working on products with real-life application and creating solutions with the end-user in mind. In my free time, I usually cycle between playing some games (recently discovered Subnautica), reading, journaling, and scouring for cafés in the city.
