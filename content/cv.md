{{< project title="NewsLines" link="https://marianafcosta.github.io/news-story-viz/" people="1" course="Dissertation">}}

Part of my dissertation, "Narrative Visualization of News Stories". A visualization interface aimed at showcasing narratives (particularly those in news stories) through storylines.

{{< project title="Real-time sports commentary" link="https://youtu.be/GFKW-izwFPI" people="8" course="LGPR">}}

A web interface for real-time sports commentary. The application was developed for **zerozero**, one of the biggest sport-centric websites in Portugal, in a **multidisciplinary team** with distinct backgrounds (namely computer engineering, multimedia, and marketing) following a **Scrum-like methodology**. Making sure the user could still use the application when offline was one of the main technical challenges, tackled with the use of **redux-offline**, **Service Workers**, and **localStorage**.
