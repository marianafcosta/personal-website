{{< project title="NewsLines" link="https://marianafcosta.github.io/news-story-viz/">}}

A visualization interface aimed at showcasing narratives (particularly those in news stories) through storylines. The prototype was built using vanilla JS and HTML/CSS, with **D3** as the visualization engine. This project allowed me to familiarize myself with D3, as well as to explore various **user research methods**, such as **interviews**, **user tests**, and **surveys**.

{{< project title="Real-time sports commentary" link="hi">}}

A web interface for real-time sports commentary. The application was developed for **zerozero**, one of the biggest sport-centric websites in Portugal, in a **multidisciplinary team** with distinct backgrounds (namely computer engineering, multimedia, and marketing) following a **Scrum-like methodology**. Making sure the user could still use the application when offline was one of the main technical challenges, tackled with the use of **redux-offline**, **Service Workers**, and **localStorage**.

{{< project title="Sistema de Planeamento e Avaliação de Refeições Escolares (SPARE)" link="hi" >}}

Re-implementation of an online platform targeting on the management of menus in school cafeterias. As **team leader** of an 8-member team, I was tasked with contributing to the **development** of the application, **managing** the team's activities, and ensuring a stable communication channel between us and the product owners. It was a great opportunity to sharpen my skills in **full-stack** development.

{{< project title="360 Company Dashboard" link="hi" >}}

A web application which provides an overview of a company’s operations and financial situation through a number of key performance indicators. The integration with **Primavera's ERP** and the correct interpretation of **SAF-T** files proved to be challenging, as none of the team members had prior experience with financial applications.

{{< project title="Neutreeko" link="hi" >}}

Web-based graphical interface for a game developed in Prolog. I had the chance to learn a bit of **WebGL** through WebCGF, a WebGL library developed at FEUP.

{{< tags "Javascript,WebGL,Prolog" >}}

{{< project title="Mel-o" link="hi" >}}

A social network for sharing user-generated stories, with a focus on music. Built **without any framework**, which allowed us to focus on the essentials of web development.
